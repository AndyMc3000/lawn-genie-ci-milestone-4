#### <br> ####

The LawnGenie.ie web application is my Milestone 4 (MS4) project for the Diploma in Fullstack Software Development course at Code Institute. The underlying goal of the project is to meet and exceed the requirements laid out for the MS4 project by Code Institute. The high-level requirement of the MS4 project is to "..build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service." 

LawnGenie.ie represents a project I have undertaken for a fictional client. I have been hired to develop an e-commerce store for a Garden Centre who want a specialist website which focuses on selling products related to the care and maintenance of lawns. 

### User Accounts  ###

All of the LawnGenie website features and functionality can be tested using one or other of the below User Accounts.

* SuperUser - Website Admin and Django Admin Account
  * UN: johndeere
  * PW: husqvarna

* Registed Customer Account

## 2. <a name="user-experience-design">User Experience Design (UX)</a> ##
#### <br> ####

The design of the LawnGenie.ie e-commerce website was determined by assessing and quantifying the goals and objectives of the business owners, as well as the requirements of users who will visit and use the website. 

Following the determination of client and user stories, and their subsequent technical requirements, the site was designed using the principles of Jesse James Garrett's '5 Planes of UX Design'. The outcome or tasks created for each of the 5 design planes is outlined below.


### 1. The Strategy Plane ###

The Strategy Plane, as defined by Jesse James Garrett "..incorporates not only what the people running the site want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the site as well." 

Please see below details of 'Client Stories' to detail the requirements of the LawnGenie.ie business owners, and 'User Stories' which highlight the requirements of the website users.

#### Client Stories ####
> - [x] "The business owners want to; "Create a specialist e-commerce store which sells products relating to the care and maintenance of Lawns."
> - [x] "The store must provide the business owners with an easy to use interface to enable to addition, editing, and deletion of products and their content. This content must include a product name, SKU, category, description, price, a product image, and rating. The interface should also allow for the addition of other attributes which may be unique to certain products, for example, a 'size' attribute for boots."
> - [x] "The store must use the Stripe payment processing platform to ensure an elegant and secure payment process for users."
> - [x] "The store design must allow users to navigate easily and intuitively through the product offering, regardless of what device they are using."

### 3. The Structure Plane ###

Please find details below about Structure Plane decision based under the following areas: Interaction Design, Information Architecture, and Data & Database Schema

#### Interaction Design: ####

Interaction design is defined as the "..development of application flows to facilitate user tasks, defining how the user interacts with site functionality". Inline with this principle, the site pages and navigation were designed as follows;

* ##### The Navigation Bar #####
  * All pages should have access to the same navigation bar.
  * The Navigation bar will contain individual links to all Product Category pages.
  * The Navigation bar will contain a link to the Blog.
  * The Navigation bar should also have a search box which when used should initiate a search of all product names and all product descriptions. A search should return a page listing all the products which are relevant to the search criteria.
  * The Navigation bar shoud also include a link to 'My Account'. When clicked this link/icon should reveal a dropdown of link options for the User. The options should be relevant to the User type, i.e.; A non-logged in user, A registered/logged-in user, and a Site Admin user. A non-logged-in User should see; Login and Registration page link options. A registered and logged-in user should see link options for; My Profile page or the Logout page. And a Site Admin should see link options for; Add a Product page, Add a Blog Post page, Send a Newsletter page, My Profile page, and Logout page.
  * The Navigation bar Should also contain a link/icon for the shopping cart. If a User has added a product to their shopping cart, the icon/link should show the total value of the current cart below the icon. If a user clicks on the cart icon, they should be taken to the shopping cart page.
  * The Navigation bar should also contain a site logo at the center of the bar. When clicked, this link should take a user back to the homepage.
 
 * ##### The Footer #####
   * The site Footer should be accessible to all pages on the site.
   * The Footer should include contact details with a link for a telephone and email address. When the email link is clicked, it should call the users default email application and open a draft email pre-populated with the sites email address.
   * The Footer should contain a logo, which when clicked should bring a User back to the Homepage.
   * The Footer should also contain a link the the Blog page, to the Newsletter subscription page, and the Newsletter unsubscribe page.

* ##### The Homepage #####
  * The Homepage should contain a hero banner section at the top of the page. This should contain marketing messaging as well as a Shop Now button. When clicked, the Shop Now button should take a User back to a page listing all products in the store.
  * The Homepage should contain a Best Sellers and a New Products section. Each section should display a product image and a More Info button for each product in the section. If either the product image or More Info button are clicked a User should be sent to the relevant Product Detail page.
  * The Homepage should also contain graphic banners promoting individual products. Each banner should contain a More Info button which when clicked brings a User to the relevant Product Page.

* ##### The Category Listing Page #####
  * The Category pages should contain a list of relevant product cards. These cards will include an individual product image and a More Info button for each product. When clicked both the image and the button will take a User to the relevant Product Detail page.
  * The Category page should also contain a Back to Top button at the bottom of a product list. When clicked this will bring a User back to the top of the Category product list.

* ##### The Product Detail Page #####
  * The Product Detail page should contain a product image which when clicked will open the image in a new browser tab.
  * The Product Detail page should have a quantity input box with a '+' and '-' link on either side of it. When this link is clicked the quantity number will increment or decrement.
  * The Product Detail page should contain a sizes dropdown box for items which have sizes as an attribute. A User can select their desired size by clicking on the dropdown.
  * The Product Detail page should have an Add To Cart button. When clicked, the product with the specified quantity and/or size will be added to the shopping cart.
  * The Product Detail page should have a Continue Shopping button. When clicked, the User will be taken back to the All Products page.

* ##### The Blog Page #####
  * The Blog page should contain a list of cards containing a title and small image for each published blog post. The card should also contain a View Post button. When any of the title, image, or button are clicked a User will be taken to the relevant Blog Detail page.
  * The Blog page should also include a Back To Top button at the bottom of the page. When clicked a User should be taken to the top of the list of blog posts. 

* ##### The Blog Detail Page #####
  * The Blog Detail page should include a Back button at the bottom of the post.


#### Information Architecture: ####

Information Architecture is defined as; "The structural design of the information space to facilitate intuitive access to content" (Copyright 2000 James Garrett).

With this in mind, please ind details below about the CPC sitemap, navigation, and security considerations.

* ##### <a name="sitemap-file">Sitemap</a> #####
  * The structure of the website is outlined in the Sitemap. Click here to view the <a href="readme/readme-assets/sitemap/lawn-genie-sitemap.png"><strong>Sitemap.</strong></a>

* ##### Navigation & Security #####
  * The website should be designed to allow users to easily and securely navigate throughout the site using the Navbar and Footer. 
  * Buttons and links should be clearly visible and communicate their purpose in an unambiguous way. 
  * The site should not allow users to access areas without access privileges. For example, a Non-registered User should not be able to access a Registered Users profile page. Nor should a Registered or Non-Registered User be able to access and Admin pages or functionality.
  * No access credentials, keys, or environment variables should be visible anywhere on the site or in the sites repository.
  * Errors should be handled gracefully through exception handling functions, where an user is shown a site page when an error occurs as opposed to a generic browser-rendered error message. The error page should briefly explain the error and offer the user redirection back to the homepage. 

#### <a name="database-schema">Data & Database Schema</a> #### 

The LawnGenie website should be designed to allow a user to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data intuitively and quickly. LawnGenie will use a Heroku PostgreSQL database to store all data. The Database will contain data based on model classes which are unique to LawnGenie, as well as builtin Django model classes 
  
* The Database Table names and key:value pairs in those Tables can be seen in the <a href="readme/readme-assets/database-schema/lawngenie-database-schema.md"><strong>Database Schema</strong></a>

### 4. The Skeleton Plane ###

Following on from the tasks decided upon in the Structure Plane, the Skeleton Plane is defined as follows; ".. The skeleton is designed to optimise the arrangement of these elements (such as the placement of buttons, tabs, photos's and blocks of text) for maximum effect and efficiency..".

With this in mind I created the below wireframes, to detail the layout of the website pages and individual sections/containers etc. Please click on the the links below to view these wireframes. 

#### <a name="wireframe-files">Wireframes</a> #### 

  * <a href="readme/readme-assets/wireframes/lawn-genie-large-screen-ver1.png"><strong>Large Screen Devices</strong></a>
  * <a href="readme/readme-assets/wireframes/lawn-genie-mobile-screen-ver1.png"><strong>Small screen/Mobile Devices</strong></a>

### 5. The Surface Plane ###

Having completed the previous 4 stages in the UX design process, I moved on to making decisions around the design and styling of the website. The Surface Plane focuses on the styling of images, backgrounds, fonts, and colours used on a website. The details of these decisions are listed here;

1. Colours - The colour scheme for the website was chosen from a selection of colours I considered when using the tools on the [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website. I created and initial colour palette of 3 colours, and then also added extra tints/shades of the orinal colours. The colours chosen, along with their HEX values, are shown here;
<img src="/readme/readme-assets/coolors/lawngenie-coolors-colour-palette.png" width="500">

1. Font - I used the Google Fonts website and Canva.com to help me decide on fonts to use for site texts and the Logo. I decided on a font from Google Fonts called 'Poppins' for all website texts. On Canva.com I found and used a font called 'Intro Rust Based Shade' for the Logo. Please see an example of both fonts here;  
<img src="/readme/readme-assets/fonts/lawngenie-fonts.png" width="500">

1. Logo Design - I created the LawnGenie logo using tools on [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/).

1. Images - I used free photos taken from the [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) website. The naming convention for each photograph includes a reference to the photographer name and the Unsplash item code. I also found promotional banners from the following websites; Husqvarna.com, Deere.co.uk, and Supersoil.ie

1. Icons - I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons throughout the site. 

1. Favicons - I used the Real Favicon Generator online service to create browser, desktop, and mobile favicons for the site. I uploaded a single favicon image to the Real Favison Generator service, and it generated a package of individual files for different devices and browser which I then downloaded. I then uploaded these files to a favicon directory in my repository, and added a list of links to the header of my base.html page. These links should then served the correct favicon to the appropriate device or browser. Unfortunately I was unable to get this working initially. If I have time at the end of the project I will try to fix this bug. You can learn more about this service here: [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

## 3. <a name="website-features">Website Features</a> ##
#### <br> ####
<hr>

The LawnGenie site employs the following features/functionality;

* Bootstrap Navigation Bar on all pages.
* Bootstrap Cards on all pages to contain content sections.
* An interface to allow store admins to add, edit, and delete products.
* Bootstrap Responsive Grid system.
* A Profile page for registered users to view/edit their delivery information and to view their order history.
* A Blog page, including an interface to allow store admins to create Blog posts.
* Django Crispy Forms for forms and form validation.
* Django ClearableFileInput from Django Forms for forms where image upload is required.
* A Newsletter subscription/unsubscribe app, including an interface to allow store admins to create Newsletters.
* Django Send Mail library for sending emails for order confirmation, registration validation and Newsletters.
* Python CRUD operations using a Heroku PostgreSQL database.
* Page Footer on all pages.

#### Future Features ####
Unfortunately I ran out of time to implement all of the site features which I had planned to implement at the beginning of the project. 

1. Django Social Media Sign-up. Required to allow users to register for an Account using their preferred Social Media account.
2. Newsletter subscriber list Admin page. Required to allow an admin to edit or delete email addresses from the Newsletter subscriber list.
3. About Us/Contact Us page. This page should also have a Google map with a branded marker on it showing the location of the business office.
4. A WYSIWYG text editor for Blog Posts and Newsletters. This would allow store admin to add text formatting to blog posts, which would make them easier to read.
5. Draft Blog Posts. I would like to add the concept of a draft for blog posts and Newsletters. This would allow and Admin to add content to a post or Newsletter and then save it without publishing.
6. A Discount Code system. This would enable a user to enter a discount code in order to receive a discount.

#### <br> ####
<hr>

<img src="readme/readme-assets/technologies-used/lawngenie-technologies-used.png" width="630">

I used the following technologies, services, and devices to develop, style, deploy, and test the LawnGenie website;
<br>
* HTML5 - The site pages were developed using HTML5 markup language.
* CSS3 - The site was styled and in some cases made responsive using CSS3.
* Python3 - All views, models, and CRUD functionality with the database was done using Python functions and classes.
* Django - I used the Django framework, libraries, and templating language to develop the LawnGenie web app.
* JavaScript & jQuery - I used JavaScript and jQuery to include functionality for; 'Back to Top' buttons, Updating product quantities, Stripe payment processing, Stripe div/card validation, and for changing the Country field requirement on the Stripe payment form. 
* Bootstrap - I used the Bootstrap framework for many of the HTML elements, including the Navbars, container Cards, and the Tables.
* GitHub - I set up a free repository on GitHub.com to maintain a master of all website files, content, and resources.
* GitPod - I used the free GitPod.io Integrated Development Environment to write and develop the code for the website.
* PostgreSQL Database - All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The Pythons functions used to create site operations/functionality interact with this database.   
* Heroku - I used the Heroku cloud-based and container-based platform-as-a-service to host and deploy the LawnGenie web app.
* Balsamiq - I used the Balsamiq application to create the website sitemap, and to create the page wireframes for PC & Tablet/Mobile views.
* TingPNG - I compressed all images on the site using the TinyPNG online image compression tool.
* W3C validators - I used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 code validators to validate my HTML and CSS.
* JSHint - I used jshint.com to validate my JavaScript code.
* PEP8Online.com - I used the PEP8 checker at Pep8online.com to check my Python code for errors.
* Responsive Viewer - I used a Chrome Browser Extension called Responsive Viewer to emulate the presentation of the website on multiple device sizes and types.
* AmIResponsive - I used the [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) webpage to view site responsiveness across devices.
* Apple Preview - I used the Apple Preview image editor application to crop and resize photo's and images, and to create some of the readme assets. 
* Apple Pages - I used the Apple Pages word processor to manage and edit text content for the website. 
* Apple Keynote - I used Apple Keynote as a sketch pad to test content and review/edit content/images.
* Apple Hardware - I used a MacBook Pro to develop the site. I also used an Apple iPhone, Apple TV, iPad and iPad Mini for testing the website.

## 6. <a name="deployment">Deployment</a> ##
#### <br> ####
<hr>

The deployment of the LanGenie site was dependent on the setup of, and integration between, a number of platforms, frameworks, tools, and a database. The below describes the steps I took in order to complete this project. These steps are split between two distinct areas, those being; Local Deployment and Remote Deployment.

### Local Deployment ###


#### 1. Project Planning ####

The first step I undertook was to create a project plan, and to organise my approach to the project. This can be described best using the following headings;

* UX Design Planning
  * This involved working through the principles of Jesse James Garrett's '5 Planes of UX Design'. This allowed me to create a series of goals and objectives for the site. The detail around this process can be seen above [Here](#user-experience-design).
* Sitemap & Wireframes
  * As part of the UX Design process I created an initial Sitemap [Here](#sitemap-file) and Mockups/Wireframes [Here](#wireframe-files) to understand how the site would be structured and what it might look like. This changed over the course of the project, but it was essential to have a specific goal in mind at the start of the project.
* Database Schema
  * Also as part of the UX Design process, I drew up an initial database schema [Here](#database-schema) to understand what kind of data would need to be stored. This changed over time, but again it was essential to understand the data requirements before starting development of the site.
* Development Plan
  * Having studied the Boutique Ado mini-project as part of my CI coursework, I drew up a rough development plan based on what I had learned in that mini-project. The below steps/activities more or less align to that initial plan.
 
#### 2. Initial Setup ####

The first technical task I completed was the setup of a local development environment, and the installation of essentials tools. This can be described best using the following headings;

* GitHub Repository
  * This site was deployed by firstly setting up a GitHub repository to store the website files. GitHub is a free online code hosting platform for websites or web applications, which enables version control and collaboration during the development of a project. A repository on GitHub contains all of a project's files and each file's revision history.
* GitPod Workspace
  * I chose to use GitPod as my development environment. Gitpod is an online container-based development platform. Having setup a new repository on GitHub, and added the Code Institute template of files, I then opened a new workspace on GitPod linked to my repository. 
* New Django Project
  * I then installed Django on my workspace. Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework which offers a range of python-based development tools and libraries.
* LawnGenie
  * Once Django was installed I created a new Django project called 'lawngenie' within it. This process creates and adds a series of files and folders to my workspace, which I would use to create the planned LawnGenie e-commerce store.
  
#### 3. Adding Django Apps ####

Django uses the 'models, templates, views' architectural pattern, used to tackle common tasks/problems in software development. It is designed to make the creation of complex websites easier. And it provides and out-of-the box administration console for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) activities. Django also has a library of different 'packages', used for setting up common website functionality and features. These packages can be easily installed in a project as required.

The features and functionality of a Django website are developed by creating a series of 'apps' which come together to create a whole. Each app offers the creation database 'models' in a models.py Python file for defining how data should be organised and used for that particular app. 'Views' can also be created in each app, which offer the ability to create a set of functions and classes. The views take a request for something and give back a response. And 'Templates' represent the front-end of the app. Templates are HTML files which interact with the models and views to allow for website interactivity by a user. Django also uses its own 'templating language' so that views can be easily called from within HTML code. 

The LawnGenie website was developed by setting up each of the below apps with Django, along with other files such as a base.html file, Bootstrap Toasts, and an integration with the Stripe billing platform. These apps and files were setup and created in the below order.

* Django AllAuth
  * This Django package offers a set of website user authentication, user registration, and account management systems.

* Base Template
  * The base.html Base Template is not a Django app, but an HTML file which Django looks for when it wants to display and app template. The base template contains blocks of HTML code which are common to all pages on a website. The app templates then contain any unique/differing html code which relate to the specific app. In LawnGenie, I created a base.html file to hold the sites scripts and links for CSS, JavaScript (which would normally be contained within the <head> of individual pages), and meta data. It also contains the HTML for the main navigation bar and site footer. As these are in the base.html file it means they could be easily injected into every other page/template across the site.

* Home App
  * This app represents the sites homepage. Its template contains the HTML for the content on the homepage. 

* Products App 
  * This app contains database models relating to products and product categories. It also contains views relating to the searching by users of products, the filtering and sorting of products, category linking, and product counts. All these views are then presented by the products app templates via a products listing template, and a product detail template. This app also offers a template where a store Admin can add new products to the store from the front-end. The views allow for the addition, editing, and deletion of products and their content. The Product Admin templates are secured so that only a store admin can access them.
 
* Shopping Cart App
  * The apps contains views which enable the adding of products to a shopping cart template. The views here also allow users to edit product quantities.
 
* Bootstrap TOASTS / Messages
  * Messaging is an important part of the LawnGenie store. Views within the various apps can send messages to users to qualify what actions they have taken. Messages are positioned to appear across all templates. LawnGenie uses a Bootstrap library of classes to style and present the message content within a message container. Message are defined as being one of the following; Success, Warning, Info, or Error. Each toast is styled to correspond to the type of message required. 
 
* Checkout App
 * This app's views manages the creation of orders, and the calculation of pricing, subtotals, delivery costs, and total cost of items in a shopping cart. Its template presents this information and a purchase form to users when they want to buy the items they have chosen. The template also presents an external Stripe billing form which connects with Stripe when a user enters their credit card details and clicks 'buy'.
 
* Profile App - After Stripe setup
 * This app was created after the integration of the Stripe billing service. It's views manage sites users in terms of their personal details, and presenting a users previous order history.
 
* Blog App
  * This app contains the data models required for a Blog. Its views allow a user to read blog posts. Like the Products app, it's views and templates
 enable a store Admin to create, edit, and delete Blog Posts from the stores front-end.
 
* Newsletter App
  * This app allows users to subscribe to, and unsubscribe from a Newsletter mailing List. It also allows a site Admin to send Email Newsletters to the subscriber list. 
 
#### 4. Integrating Stripe ####

The Stripe Payment service works by creating a secure connection with a server. Stripe does this by providing an element or secure area within a site which it manages using JavaScript code embedded in the site. To a user this element is represented by a credit card input field. When they input their card details and click buy, a request is sent to Stripe to create directly. A users card details are never stored on the website, nor is it visible to anyone managing the website.
 
Following this initial connection, Stripe then sends back a message or webhook to say the payment has been created by Stripe. Webhooks can be created an used by a website to communicate for lots of reasons. But primarily they are used to ensure no errors occur between the time when a user clicks buy, and when their purchase has been confirmed by Stripe. LawnGenie uses webhooks to ensure that an order will always be added to the database after a user clicks buy. Even if the user' browser crashes while Stripe is still processing the payment.
 

### Remote Deployment ###

Once all the required apps, files, and the Stripe service were in place, the site was ready to deploy to a production environment on a hosting service. Once done it would operate independently of the GitPod development environment. Following deployment, the production site is now hosted on the Heroku with the site's images and CSS style/static files being hosted on Amazon Web Services' S3 cloud storage service. 

Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The Heroku platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers an easy path to getting their apps to market. By connecting the LawnGenie repository to a newly created Heroku app the site is securely hosted on the Heroku service.

Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, And by connecting that service to Heroku, the store has a robust storage solution for the site images and static content. 
 
Following deployment, any changes I made on my GitPod IDE (and which were then 'pushed' to my GitHub repository), were automatically pushed to my Heroku app too. Heroku takes the newly updated files from GitHub and attempts to redeploy the site with its changes automatically.

As the store on Heroku now has front-end interfaces for a store Admin to create, edit, and delete content (everything related to products, blog posts, or the newsletter mailing list it doesn't require the manual upload of images etc to AWS in order to update content. The fictitious client who owns the store can run it without any technical skills on a day to day basis.
