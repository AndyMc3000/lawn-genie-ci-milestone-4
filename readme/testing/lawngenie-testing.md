## 3. <a name="code-validation">Code Validation</a> ##

I ran the website through the W3C validators for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I also ran my JavaScript & jQuery code through the [JSHint.com](https://jshint.com/) code checker, and used the PEP8 checker at [PEP8online.com](http://pep8online.com/) to check my Python code for PEP8 compliance.  

#### HTML ####

The W3C CSS Validation Service. The validator highlighted the following warning for index.html. No other errors or warnings were found.

* "Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections." - I decide not to 'fix' the issue this warning relates to. It relates to the title of the introduction section which is a h1 title. I decide to leave it as a h1 as it looks better like this when underneath the 'hero' carousel.

#### CSS ####

The W3C CSS Validation Service. The validator found the following errors. No toher warnings or erros were found.

* The validator highlighted 18 Errors and 768 Warnings relating to the bootstrap.min.css style sheet. I queried this with Tutor Support and was advised that these were acceptable issues as I have no control over the CDN-delivered Bootstrap style sheet.

#### JavaScript & jQuery ####

I ran my script.js file through the JSHint validator and foucn the following Warnings. No errors were found.

* Eight warnings - the following show the line number of the warning and the warning description;
18	Missing semicolon.
21	Missing semicolon.
28	Missing semicolon.
29	Missing semicolon.
32	Missing semicolon.
33	Missing semicolon.
34	Missing semicolon.
35	Missing semicolon.

* One undefined variable
63	emailjs

* The warnings described relate to the Bootstrap from validation JavaScript. When I attempted to resolve these warnings, by adding semicolon's in the relvant places, it broke the form validation feature. As a result I reverted to the otiginal Bootstrap code.
* I also left the EmailJS variable warning 'as is', as I couldn't find a fix for it and didn't wntn to break the Contact Us Form EmailJS feature. 

#### Python ####

I ran my app.py file through the PEP8online.com Python validator and found the following Error. 

* Error Code	Line	Column	Text
* E128	      89	  13	    continuation line under-indented for visual indent

I fixed this error by continuing the relevant line of code onto the next line in app.py. I then repeated the test and got an 'All right' messgae from the validator.

## 6. <a name="bugs-discovered">Bugs Discovered / Remedies</a> ##

While developing and testing the site I discovered the below bugs/issues. If I founc a remedy to a bug I have listed this below.

#### Bugs Discovered / Remedies ####
1. Bootstrap form validation - When I tried to validate the JavaScript code I got from Bootsrap on JSHint.com, it thrw back warnings saying the code was missing semi-colons. So, I added them to my code. However this stopped the vaidation so I had to revert to the original code.
1. CSS animation error - I added the animation property to my style.css along with the required vendor prefixes and @keyframe syntax. When I ran my code through the W3 Jigsaw validator, it threw errors for my animation code. I did some research and it seems that W3/CSS specification don't yet recognise vendor prefixes. As such I removed the animation code to ensure I ran no errors.
1. Bootstrap CSS errors. When I ran my site through the W3 Jigsaw CSS validator it through multiple warnings and erros for the Bootstrap CDN-linked CSS file in my base.html. I discussed this with Student Support and was advised that as it was a Bootstra file (and I have no control over it), it was acceptable to leave this as is. 
1. EMailJS Console error - The EmailJS JavaScript code produces and 'AddEventListener' error in the console. I didn't have time to find a solution to this.
1. HTML validator warning - The W3 HTML validator produced a Warning in regard to a section not having an accetable heading. It relates to the Introduction section on index.html. I decided to leave this issue as is, as it looks better on the page to have a H1 there instead of a H2 to H6 version of the text.
1. Floating Footer - When I initally created my base.html and index.html templates and added a navbar and footer, the footbar did not behave itself. It was 'floating' up from the bottom of the page and hugging the bottom of the last container on the page. I did some research and found that I could fix it by applying some CSS to it. I added the 'Margin-Top: auto' property and value and it fixed the issue.
1. On a previous project I had a bug with form submission where Bootstrap was validating a contact form after it had been 'submit' and 'reset'. As the form had been reset, this resulted in Bootstrap validation errors appearing on the blank form after form submission. This may give a user the impression that their message/form had not been sent, even though an Alert had been sent to the browser to confirm that the message had been sent. This is a known issue with Bootstrap. With help from Tutor support and a Google search I found some jQuery code on a GitHub chat thread which fixed the problem. When I added the code to my EmailJS JavaScript code on script.js it fixed the problem. See that GitHub thread here - ['Resetting form doesn't clear validation errors'](https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/issues/68). 
1. Safari datepicker. I found that Safari does not HTML datepicker. I found a jQuery-based solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35682138/html5-date-picker-doesnt-show-on-safari), but didn't have time to implement/test it.
