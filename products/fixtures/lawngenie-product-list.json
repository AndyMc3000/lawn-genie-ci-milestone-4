   "description": "The Worx Nitro WG753 40V Power Share Cordless 21" Self-Propelled Lawn Mower with Rear Wheel Drive and 2X 5.0Ah Batteries has a highly-efficient brushless motor running 50% longer, churning out 25% more power, and providing 10% more life than brushed motors. With two high-capacity Power Share PRO batteries, this self-propelled mower is a worthy replacement to gas mowers. And does so without any of the drawbacks of gas, like the cost, mess, fumes, excessive volume, or extra maintenance. Full of quality-of-life features, like rear-wheel drive with a variable-speed control so the user can pick a pace that’s comfortable for them. Single-lever height adjustments and mode changes make switching between cutting heights (7-positions, 1.6 in.-4 in.) and cutting modes (bag/mulch/side-discharge) quick and easy. LED lights provide greater visibility when mowing at dusk or in other low-light conditions. Auto-Intellicut™ technology increases the speed of the blades when it detects thicker grass, then slows them back down when the mowing gets easier to conserve battery usage. And the one-touch fully-collapsible handle makes for compact, stand-up storage in the garage. The bag capacity is 2 Bushels, the wheels are 8 in. (front) and 10 in. (rear). The durable steel cutting deck is a wide 21 in. (20 in. cutting width) and great for lawns with rough terrain, and features Nutricut™ dual-stage mulching capabilities to return both water and nutrients back to your lawn.",

The tank is a translucent colour with graduated markings and the lance can be clipped into the pump handle for easy storage. The trigger lock can create a continuous flow of spray which is very easy to turn on. It is important to consider the time you spray your pesticides. If you apply it just before rain the pesticides can leach through the soil and contaminate entire habitats. The best time to use a pesticide is on a cloudy day when temperatures are moderate and the soil should be moderately dry. Never apply pesticide when there is wind to prevent the chemical from drifting to non-target areas.",

   "description": "Quiet, versatile and intelligently designed - that's the GARDENA SILENO city. The SILENO city is ideal for smaller lawns. Once you enter the lawn size, desired inactive days and preferred start time in the installation assistant, you're ready to go. Your mowing robot calculates the required mowing time and schedule all by itself - so convenient! The SILENO delivers high performance and convenient mowing, thanks to its quiet engine your neighbours won't even notice when the mowing robot goes into action. The SILENO city gets on with its mowing job on its own, whatever the weather, rain or shine. The lawn always looks wonderfully well-manicured. The CorridorCut system ensures that even narrow spaces from 60 cm and dead ends are mowed perfectly. This saves you having to mow the narrow sections in the garden yourself. Thanks to the SensorControl function for grass growth your robot lawnmower can determine itself how often it mows. It decides by the height of the grass if it is a good moment for mowing – or not. The SILENO city keeps the stalks accurately to length and you can enjoy your leisure time. The boundary wire indicates to the SILENO city which area of the lawn should be mowed and the guide wire directs the robotic mower reliably and fully automatically around all mowing areas, even through bottlenecks, and back to the charging station. It mows completely autonomously; this means more relaxation for you and time to really enjoy your garden without the chore of cutting the grass. Even gradients of up to 35 percent are no problem. The SILENO city can be cleaned easily with a garden hose, it couldn't be simpler. Lawn mowing becomes so easy with the SILENO city, just sit back, relax and watch the robotic mower do the hard work for you. You will wonder how you ever managed without it! And of course - it's a GARDENA.",
