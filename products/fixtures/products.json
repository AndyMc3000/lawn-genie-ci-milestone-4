      "description": "The Worx Nitro WG753 40V Power Share Cordless Self-Propelled Lawn Mower with Rear Wheel Drive and 2X 5.0Ah Batteries has a highly-efficient brushless motor running 50% longer, churning out 25% more power, and providing 10% more life than brushed motors. With two high-capacity Power Share PRO batteries, this self-propelled mower is a worthy replacement to gas mowers. And does so without any of the drawbacks of gas, like the cost, mess, fumes, excessive volume, or extra maintenance. Full of quality-of-life features, like rear-wheel drive with a variable-speed control so the user can pick a pace that’s comfortable for them. Single-lever height adjustments and mode changes make switching between cutting heights (7-positions, 1.6 in.-4 in.) and cutting modes (bag/mulch/side-discharge) quick and easy. LED lights provide greater visibility when mowing at dusk or in other low-light conditions. Auto-Intellicut™ technology increases the speed of the blades when it detects thicker grass, then slows them back down when the mowing gets easier to conserve battery usage. And the one-touch fully-collapsible handle makes for compact, stand-up storage in the garage. The bag capacity is 2 Bushels, the wheels are 8 in. (front) and 10 in. (rear). The durable steel cutting deck is a wide 21 in. (20 in. cutting width) and great for lawns with rough terrain, and features Nutricut™ dual-stage mulching capabilities to return both water and nutrients back to your lawn.",

This lawn watering kit is designed for areas measuring 50m² and can be extended to cover areas up to 200m² by purchasing additional Colibri sprinklers and accessories. Because of the unique design of the Colibri pop-up sprinklers, this kit can easily be run from a low-pressure water supply. When in use, the pop-up sprinklers rise out of the ground and evenly waters your lawn with a gentle uniform rain effect, and then retract back underground when the system is turned off. For full automation, purchase a water timer to time when the watering system is turned on and off.",

If you apply it just before rain the pesticides can leach through the soil and contaminate entire habitats. The best time to use a pesticide is on a cloudy day when temperatures are moderate and the soil should be moderately dry. Never apply pesticide when there is wind to prevent the chemical from drifting to non-target areas.",
